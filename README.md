# Final-Capstone-Project on MAVERIK

**Business Problem and Project Objective Summary:**

*Business Problem:* The business problem for Maverik is centered around planning, forecasting, and reporting for their new stores. Specifically, they need to provide accurate daily forecasts for a new store's first-year sales. This involves creating a model that can predict daily sales for upcoming new stores for the first year, taking into account seasonality and multiple sales metrics. The primary challenge is to improve upon their current Naïve Model to achieve better accuracy in forecasting.

*Project Objective:* The primary objective is to create a robust daily-level forecasting model for various sales metrics—Diesel Gallons, Unleaded Gallons, in-store merchandise, and food service. This model aims to significantly enhance forecasting accuracy for upcoming new stores, facilitating improved financial planning, efficient resource allocation, heightened customer satisfaction, and streamlined operational efficiency.


**Group's Solution to the Business Problem:**

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*

The group conducted an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the influential factors affecting sales metrics. This involved:

*Seasonality and Trends:* Identifying seasonal patterns and trends in sales metrics, especially regarding higher sales during certain periods (e.g., summer vs. winter) and potential growth trends.

*External Factors:* Analyzing the impact of external factors such as holidays, weekdays vs. weekends, and other relevant events on sales patterns.


*Modeling Techniques with Relevant Factors:*

*Prophet Model Integration:* Utilizing  Prophet model to handle seasonality and incorporate holiday effects, allowing for flexible adjustments based on external factors.

*ARIMA and SARIMA with Seasonal Components:* Adapting ARIMA and SARIMA models to account for seasonal variations and patterns observed during specific periods.

*ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality) Incorporating External Influences:* Within the ETS framework, considering the influence of external factors on the error, trend, and seasonality components to capture their impact on sales metrics.

*XGBoost's Non-linear Handling of Factors:* Utilizing XGBoost's ability to capture non-linear relationships between sales metrics and external factors, enabling the model to adapt to complex interactions.


*Iterative Model Refinement and Consideration of Factors:*

The iterative refinement process involved continually assessing the performance of each model against external factors, such as holidays, special events, and seasonality. This process aimed to:

*Evaluate Impact:* Assess the influence of external factors on model accuracy and performance.

*Fine-tuning Parameters:* Iteratively adjusting model parameters based on observed impacts to improve forecast accuracy in the presence of relevant external factors.


*Outcome:*

By incorporating the analysis of seasonality, trends, and external factors into the modeling techniques including Prophet, ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, and XGBoost, the group aims to provide Maverik with a holistic forecasting solution. This solution aims to offer more accurate daily sales forecasts for new stores, considering and adapting to the impact of various relevant factors. Ultimately, this will support enhanced financial planning, operational efficiency, and improved customer satisfaction.

This gives the company a competitive advantage by anticipating market shifts, staying agile, and making proactive decisions.


**Leveraging the Qualitative Dataset for Comprehensive Business Solutions:**

In addition to the quantitative models, the incorporation of the qualitative dataset adds a deeper layer of insight to our business solution for Maverik. By analyzing qualitative factors such as store attributes, demographics, and amenities, our project aims to provide Maverik with a holistic understanding of its stores' operational dynamics and customer-centric opportunities. The qualitative dataset, encompassing attributes like store size, amenities offered (such as Freals, Cinnabon, car wash availability), and demographic details within various radiuses, empowers Maverik to make informed decisions for each store's performance enhancement and strategic planning.

*Enhanced Store Operations:* Insights into features like store layouts, fueling positions, checkout availability, and restroom facilities support improved operational decisions. For instance, understanding the efficiency of traditional vs. high flow forecourt layouts can influence the layout planning of new stores.

*Tailored Customer Engagement:* Analysis of offered amenities, fuel types, and convenience offerings (like RV lanes or electric vehicle charging) enables customized customer engagement strategies based on regional preferences and demands.

*Strategic Expansion Planning:* Demographic data, such as population and income within different radiuses, aids in identifying prime locations for future store expansion or renovations.
